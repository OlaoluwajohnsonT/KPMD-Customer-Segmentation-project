Analysis of Skyrocketed PTY LTD customer data to Identify the High-Value Customers and How to Target them 

As I embarked on this journey to achieve growth and expand the market presence, I found myself at the helm of a significant endeavor for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. The company is renowned for providing top-tier bicycles and cycling accessories, but its ambitions reached further - to understand its customers at a granular level.

The company's primary objective was crystal clear: I utilize data to unravel customer behavior and preferences. Amidst a cohort of 1000 new potential customers, the task was to identify and prioritize those with the highest potential to become potential customers.

To achieve this, I harnessed the wealth of existing customer data available. Through meticulous analysis, I aimed to create customer segments that transcended mere demographics, illuminating shared traits, behaviors, and preferences.

This project was more than numbers and figures; it was about the analysis of customer segmentation. It was about translating data into actionable insights that shaped the company strategy and led it to a future of sustained success in the competitive cycling and accessories market.
