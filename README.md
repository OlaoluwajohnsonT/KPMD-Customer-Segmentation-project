Analysis of Skyrocketed PTY LTD customer data to Identify the High-Value Customer and How to Target them 

As we embarked on our journey to achieve growth and expand our market presence, I found myself at the helm of a significant endeavor for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd. We were renowned for providing top-tier bicycles and cycling accessories, but our ambitions reached further - to understand our customers at a granular level.

Our primary objective was crystal clear: we set out on a data-driven journey to unravel customer behavior and preferences. Amidst a cohort of 1000 new potential customers, our task was to identify and prioritize those with the highest potential to become cherished patrons.

To achieve this, I harnessed the wealth of existing customer data at our disposal. Through meticulous analysis, I aimed to create customer segments that transcended mere demographics, illuminating shared traits, behaviors, and preferences.

This project was more than numbers and figures; it was about the art and science of customer segmentation. It was about translating data into actionable insights that shaped our strategy and led us to a future of sustained success in the competitive cycling and accessories market. Join me on this exciting journey of discovery and growth that we undertook for Sprocket Central Pty Ltd.
